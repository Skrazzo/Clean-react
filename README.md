## This is the clean version of react, without any prebuilt shit
Just clone repo, and run `./init_clean_react.sh`
1. it will remove old git folder `sudo rm -rd .git/`
2. start a new one `git init`
3. run `npm i` to install everything needed
4. and run `npm start` to start the project

### I also installed these packages as pre-installed packages:
* tailwindcss
* scss
* axios
